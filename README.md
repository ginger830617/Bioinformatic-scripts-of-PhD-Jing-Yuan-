# PhD project: Epigeneic Regulatory Network Analysis of Human Glioblastomas

Bioinformatic-scripts
The scripts for all the transcriptome analysis including RNA-seq analysis, differential expression analysis, chromosome analysis

1. We have three RNA-seq datasets which from high grade glioma tumour tissue from University of Warwick shaire and Coventry (UHCW), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and PRRX1 overexpressed Hek293 cell lines.
2. Differential expression analysis of protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs and transposons based on RNA-seq datasets of high grade glioma tumour tissue from UHCW.
3. Differential expression analysis of protein-coding genes based on RNA-seq datasets of PRRX1 overexpressed Hek293 cell lines.
4. Chromosomal abnormalities analysis of high grade glioma tumour tissue from UHCW
5. The coordinates used in all RNA-seq analysis can be downloaed from GENCODE https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/:
6. PRRX1 overexpressed HEK293 cell line: gencode.v38.annotation.gtf    GRCh38.p13.genome.fa
7. Transposable elements of UHCW: GRCh38.p13.genome.fa    hg38_rmsk_TE.gtf
8. Non-coding RNA of UHCW: gencode.v28.lncRNA_transcripts.fa  gencode.v28.long_noncoding_RNAs.gtf
9. Coding genes of UHCW: GRCh38.d1.vd1.fa   gencode.v22.annotation.gtf
10. Chromosomal abnormalities analysis of RNA-seq datasets of UHCW: hg38.fa   hg38.gtf
