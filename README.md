# PhD project: Epigeneic Regulatory Network Analysis of Human Glioblastomas

Bioinformatic-scripts
The scripts for all the transcriptome analysis including RNA-seq analysis, differential expression analysis, chromosome analysis

1. RNA-seq dataset analysis of high grade glioma tumour tissue from University of Warwick shaire and Coventry
2. RNA-seq dataset analysis of PRRX1 overexpressed Hek293 cell lines
3. Differential expression analysis of protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs and transposons
4. Chromosomal abnormalities analysis of high grade glioma tumour tissue from University of Warwick shaire and Coventry
5. The coordinates used in all RNA-seq analysis can be downloaed from GENCODE https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/:
   PRRX1 overexpressed HEK293 cell line: gencode.v38.annotation.gtf    GRCh38.p13.genome.fa
   Transposable elements of UHCW: GRCh38.p13.genome.fa    GRCh38_rmsk_TE
   Non-coding RNA of UHCW: gencode.v28.lncRNA_transcripts.fa gencode.v28.long_noncoding_RNAs.gtf    
   Coding genes of UHCW: GRCh38.d1.vd1.fa   gencode.v22.annotation.gtf
